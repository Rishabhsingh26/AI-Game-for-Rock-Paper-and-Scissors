# AI-Game-for-Rock-Paper-and-Scissors
 Importing Required Modules
python
Copy
Edit
import random
The random module is used to allow the computer to randomly choose between rock, paper, and scissors.
2. Function to Generate Computerâ€™s Choice
python
Copy
Edit
def get_computer_choice():
    return random.choice(["rock", "paper", "scissors"])
This function randomly selects one of the three possible moves (rock, paper, or scissors).
The random.choice() function picks one item from the provided list.
3. Function to Determine the Winner
python
Copy
Edit
def determine_winner(player, computer):
    if player == computer:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (player == "rock" and computer == "scissors") or \
         (player == "scissors" and computer == "paper") or \
         (player == "paper" and computer == "rock"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"
This function takes both the playerâ€™s and computerâ€™s choices as input.
It checks for a tie first.
Then, it uses conditional statements to determine if the player wins (e.g., Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock).
If none of these conditions are met, the computer wins.
4. Main Game Function
python
Copy
Edit
def play_game():
    print("Welcome to Rock-Paper-Scissors!")
    
    while True:
        player_choice = input("Enter rock, paper, or scissors (or 'quit' to stop): ").lower()
The function starts by displaying a welcome message.
It runs in a continuous loop, allowing the user to play multiple rounds.
The player inputs their choice, which is converted to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.
5. Handling User Input
python
Copy
Edit
        if player_choice == "quit":
            print("Thanks for playing!")
            break
If the user enters "quit", the game thanks the player and exits the loop, ending the game.
python
Copy
Edit
        if player_choice not in ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]:
            print("Invalid choice, try again.")
            continue
If the input is not "rock", "paper", or "scissors", the program informs the user that their input is invalid and prompts them again.
6. Computer's Choice and Result Calculation
python
Copy
Edit
        computer_choice = get_computer_choice()
        print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
The computer randomly selects its move using the get_computer_choice() function.
The computerâ€™s choice is then displayed to the user.
python
Copy
Edit
        print(determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice))
The winner is determined using the determine_winner() function, and the result is displayed.
7. Running the Game
python
Copy
Edit
play_game()
This line starts the game by calling the play_game() function.
How the Code Works in a Game Session
The program starts and welcomes the player.
The player enters "rock", "paper", or "scissors", or they can enter "quit" to stop playing.
The computer randomly selects its choice.
The program determines the winner and displays the result.
The loop continues until the player enters "quit".
Possible Enhancements
AI Learning: The AI could analyze past player choices to predict future moves.
GUI Integration: Convert the game into a graphical interface.
Scoring System: Keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
